# Python TSP solver for waste collection 
In a bid to entrance into a french engineer school, I had to work on the theme "Transition, Transformation, Conversion". Therefore, I decided to focus on the waste collection probleme in Bordeaux (French City).
First, I wanted to work on household daily waste, but there were too much difficulties (and in the real life, the optimisation depends on on-field agents' experience).
This is why I wanted to study the situation for the voluntary drop-off points (glass columns or alimentary waste) whose informatic optimisation is used by private companies or municipalities.

you can have access to all data that you need. Indeed, the name of the differents roads, the properties of the ways and the direction of traffic being extrated, I was able to build a graph of Bordeaux from scratch.
