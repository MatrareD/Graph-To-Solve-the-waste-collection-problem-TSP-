# Python TSP solver for waste collection 
In a bid to enroll in an french engineer university, I had to work on the theme "Transition, Transformation, Conversion". Therefore, I decided to focus on the waste collection probleme in Bordeaux (French City).
First, I wanted to work on household daily waste, but there were too much difficulties (and in the real life, the optimisation depends on on-field agents' experience).
This is why I wanted to study the situation for the voluntary drop-off points (glass columns or alimentary waste) whose informatic optimisation is used.
